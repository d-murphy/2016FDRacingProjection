# 2016FDRacingProject

The repository hosts a simulation model used to provide probabilities on the outcome of a contest between New York State Firefighters.  [This video shows an excellent example of one of the 8 contests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35Eo96MdW4A).  

The code here cleans the data,  takes summary statistics on all runs leading up to the Championship drill, and then creates 300 simulated drills based on the summary statistics.  The results are presented in several data visualization.  See the files below for each phase of the project:
